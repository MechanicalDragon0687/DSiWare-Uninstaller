# DSiWare Uninstaller

This app attempts to uninstall every DSiWare currently on the system except for the known system dsiware.
If this inadvertently removes system dsiware, a system update will resolve this issue.

If an app fails to be deleted, please visit the Nintendo Homebrew discord for assistance on removing the app.
